h2. SproutCore - Testing Guidelines

This guide covers using test-driven development (TDD) techniques to develop SproutCore applications.
After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* Write tests for methods to be implemented and use them to help you implement them.
* Write tests to verify that your observers fire when you expect them to.
* Write tests that verify your bindings fire when you expect them to and how to
incorporate +SC.RunLoop+ so that they will function.
* _TODO_: more
