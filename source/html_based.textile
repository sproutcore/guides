h2. Getting Started With HTML-Based Apps

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* Use SproutCore's templating support to describe the appearance of your application.
* Delegate handling of user events with views.
* Use bindings to update views when your models change.

You will learn all of this by building a real Todo list application from the ground up using SproutCore.

endprologue.

h3. Generate Your New Application

First, generate your new HTML-based application.

<shell>
$ sc-init todos --template
</shell>

This will create several files needed for your application, inside the *+apps/todos+* directory.

* *apps/*
** *todos/*
*** *todos.js* - The JavaScript file that will define your models, views, and controllers
*** *resources/*
**** *templates/* - Place all Handlebars templates here.
***** *todos.handlebars* - The main template for the application
**** *images/* - Place all image assets here.
**** *stylesheets/* - Place all css here
***** *todos.css* - The CSS to style your views
*** *tests/*
* *Buildfile* - Tells SproutCore how your application should be built. Usually, you can just use the defaults provided.
* *README*

Go ahead and open +todos.js+ now. You should see the following code:

<javascript filename="apps/todos/todos.js">
Todos = SC.Application.create();

SC.ready(function() {
  Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({
    layerId: "todo",
    templateName: "todos"
  });
});
</javascript>

This code creates a namespace for your application (called +Todos+), then appends a new pane. A pane is responsible for event delegation and placing your templates into the DOM, but you'll learn more about that later.

h3. Defining Your Model

In this tutorial, we want to create a list for managing todos. Users should be able to create a new todo with a specific task, then check it off once it's done.

Let's define our model as a new subclass of +SC.Object+:

<javascript filename="apps/todos/todos.js">
Todos = SC.Application.create();

Todos.Todo = SC.Object.extend({
  title: null,
  isDone: false
});

SC.ready(function() {
  Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({
    layerId: 'todos',
    templateName: 'todos'
  });
});
</javascript>

NOTE: Make sure you insert the new code after the +Todos+ object is created.

We've now defined a class with two properties: +title+, a string, and +isDone+, a Boolean.

h3. Managing the Model Using a Controller

Now that we know what our data looks like, let's create a controller to manage it. Since we want to maintain an ordered list of todos, we'll use an instance of +SC.ArrayController+.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// at the end of the file

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({
  // Initialize the array controller with an empty array.
  content: []
});
</javascript>

INFO: In MVC frameworks, like SproutCore, the controller layer bridges the model layer, which is only concerned with a pure-data representation of objects, and the view layer, which is only concerned with representing those objects.

Now we have an array controller with no content. Let's add a method to create a new todo:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating previous code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({
  // Initialize the array controller with an empty array.
  content: [],

  // Creates a new todo with the passed title, then adds it
  // to the array.
  createTodo: function(title) {
    var todo = Todos.Todo.create({ title: title });
    this.pushObject(todo);
  }
});
</javascript>

NOTE: +SC.ArrayController+ acts as a proxy onto its +content+ Array. SproutCore will propagate any modifications made to the +ArrayController+ to the +content+ Array.

h3. Creating New Todos with a Text Field

NOTE: At this point, you should download "the CSS":https://github.com/sproutcore/Todos-Example/raw/master/apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos.css and save it as +apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos.css+.

We've got our model and controller set up, so let's move on to the fun part: creating the interface for our users. The first step is to create a text field into which the user types the name of their todo.

To start building our views, let's open +resources/templates/todos.handlebars+ and add some markup:

<html filename="todos.handlebars">
<h1>Todos</h1>
<input id="new-todo" type="text"
       placeholder="What needs to be done?" >
</html>

NOTE: For more information about using Handlebars, visit the "Handlebars website":http://handlebars.strobeapp.com/.

Now that we've got model, view, and controller represented, it's time to open the app in our browser and see how it looks.

During the development process, +sc-server+ makes it easy to test your application. Just run the following inside of your project directory:

<shell>
$ sc-server

Starting server at http://0.0.0.0:4020 in debug mode
To quit sc-server, press Control-C
>> Thin web server (v1.2.7 codename No Hup)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4020, CTRL+C to stop
</shell>

Open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:4020/todos":http://localhost:4020/todos. You should see your application load. Once you have it up and running, it's time to tell SproutCore how to handle events for your <code><input></code> tag. When the user presses +return+, we want to create a new Todo and have it inserted into the array controller.

NOTE: In SproutCore, whenever you want to display dynamic content or handle events, you will need to attach your HTML to a view object.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.CreateTodoView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.TextFieldSupport, {
  insertNewline: function() {
    var value = this.get('value');

    if (value) {
      Todos.todoListController.createTodo(value);
      this.set('value', '');
    }
  }
});
</javascript>

Because +CreateTodoView+ contains a text field, we mix in +SC.TextFieldSupport+, which provides several conveniences, including a +value+ property, and higher level events such as +insertNewline+, for when the user presses +return+.

NOTE: When creating a new object, you can include a mixin, which will extend the default behavior of the class. In this case, we extend the default +TemplateView+ behavior with functionality specific to views that wrap input tags. You can include as many mixins as you'd like by passing them as parameters to +create()+ and +extend()+.

Now that we have defined our view, we need to attach it to HTML in our Handlebars template.

<html filename="apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<h1>Todos</h1>
{{#view Todos.CreateTodoView}}
<input id="new-todo" type="text"
       placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
{{/view}}
</html>

+#view+ is a Handlebars block helper that assigns an +SC.TemplateView+ to a section of HTML. This means that the behavior described in the specified view, such as event handling, will get associated with the HTML inside the block.

Now that we have UI to create new todos, let's create the interface to display them.  We'll use the +#collection+ helper to display a list of items. +#collection+ will create an instance of +SC.TemplateCollectionView+ that renders every item in its underlying Array using the enclosed HTML.

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- at the end of the file -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView}}
  {{content.title}}
{{/collection}}
</html>

Back in +todos.js+, we need to define the collection class that we passed to the +collection+ helper. To define the collection's underlying +Array+, we bind its +content+ property to the +todoListController+. In this case, that means that the +todoListView+ will create a <code><div></code> containing the Todo's +title+ for each item in the +todoListController+.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// at the end of the file

Todos.TodoListView = SC.TemplateCollectionView.extend({
  contentBinding: 'Todos.todoListController'
});
</javascript>

NOTE: You set up bindings by creating a property whose name ends in +Binding+. In this case, we bind +Todos.todoListController+ to the +Todos.TodoListView+'s +content+ property. When one end of a binding changes, SproutCore will automatically update the other end.

Open up "http://localhost:4020/todos":"http://localhost:4020/todos in your browser (or reload if you still have it open). It should look the same as before. Type a todo into the text field and hit return.

Look at that! As soon as we create a new todo and insert it into the array controller, the view updates automatically.

You've now seen a little bit of the power of SproutCore. By using SproutCore's bindings to describe the relationship between your data and your views, you were able to change the data layer and let SproutCore do the hard work of updating the view layer for you.

NOTE: This is actually a core concept in SproutCore, not just something that demos well.  SproutCore's binding system is designed with the view system in mind, which makes it easy to work directly with your data and not need to worry about manually keeping your view layer in sync. You will see this concept over and over again in the rest of this tutorial and in other guides.

h3. Getting Things Done

We now have the ability to add todos, but no way to mark them as done. Before the frustration of a never-ending todo list gets the better of us, let's add the ability to mark todos as complete.

The first thing we need to do is add a checkbox to each todo view. If we want to handle user input, we need to assign a view to the checkbox. In this case, we want to be notified whenever the value of the checkbox is changed by the user. Remember that we assign views using the +#view+ helper. Here's what the todo list looks like after updating it in +todos.handlebars+:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- replacing the previous code -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView}}
  <label>
    {{#view Todos.CheckboxView}}
      <input class="check" type="checkbox">
    {{/view}}
    {{content.title}}
  </label>
{{/collection}}
</html>

Now implement +Todos.CheckboxView+, which we just assigned. Because our view wraps an +input+ tag of type +checkbox+, we mix in +SC.CheckboxSupport+. This gives the view a +value+ property that reflects the value in the DOM, and, because it is a SproutCore property, we can observe any changes to it.

INFO: Under the hood, SproutCore binds an event handler to the +change+ event and updates +value+ when the event occurs. This may change as needed for browser compatibility, and working with a SproutCore property insulates you from those concerns.

For every item in its underlying +Array+, +SC.TemplateCollectionView+ will create a new child view whose +content+ property contains the object the view should represent. In our case, there will be a child view for each todo, and each will have a +content+ property set to a corresponding +Todo+ object.

This makes it easy to bind the value of the checkbox to the value of +isDone+, so that when one changes, the other changes automatically. Let's tie it all together:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.CheckboxView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  classNames: ['checkbox'],

  valueBinding: '.parentView.content.isDone'
});
</javascript>

Until now, SproutCore has been creating item views for each +Todo+ for us. Often, you will want to add custom behavior to these views. In that case, you can provide your +SC.TemplateCollectionView+ with an +SC.TemplateView+ subclass that it will use instead.

In our todos app, we want to display completed todos in a different visual style than uncompleted todos. We'll do that using CSS, but first we'll need to add an HTML +class+ so the browser can distinguish between the two.

We'll use a property on the collection helper to set up this binding:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- replacing the previous code -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView itemClassBinding="content.isDone"}}
  <label>
    {{#view Todos.CheckboxView}}
      <input class="check" type="checkbox">
    {{/view}}
    {{content.title}}
  </label>
{{/collection}}
</javascript>

This property defines a binding on each of the item views. Each item will get the class +is-done+ if its associated content object is +isDone+. SproutCore will automatically dasherize property names into class names.

NOTE: All views have a number of properties, including +id+, +class+, and +classBinding+. The +collection+ helper allows you to prefix any of those properties with +item+, which will then apply them to each of the child item views. For instance, if you use the +itemClass+ property on a collection, each item will get that class.

Reload your application in the browser and try it out. As soon as you click a todo's checkbox, the text will become crossed out. Keep in mind you didn't need to update any views when marking the +Todo+ as done; bindings did it for. If a different part of the app changes the +Todo+ item's +isDone+ property, your list item would automatically update without any more work on your part.

h3. The More You Know

We can now create todos and mark them as being complete. While 76% of all statistics are made up, let's see if we can display more accurate information from the data we have.  At the bottom of our list, let's display the number of todos remaining. Open +todos.handlebars+ and put this at the bottom:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- after the create todo view -->

{{#view Todos.StatsView id="stats"}}
  {{displayRemaining}}
{{/view}}
</html>

The +bind+ helper allows us to automatically update the DOM when a property on our view changes. In this case, we're saying that we should insert the value of the view's +displayRemaining+ property whenever it changes.

Let's go ahead and implement that view in +todos.js+ now:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.StatsView = SC.TemplateView.extend({
  remainingBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.remaining',

  displayRemaining: function() {
    var remaining = this.get('remaining');
    return remaining + (remaining === 1 ? " item" : " items");
  }.property('remaining').cacheable()
});
</javascript>

+displayRemaining+ contains a pluralized string, based on the number of remaining todos.  We call this a *computed property*. Computed properties are properties whose value is determined by running a function. For example, if +remaining+ equals +1+, +displayRemaining+ will contain the string +"1 item"+.

We say that +displayRemaining+ *depends on* +remaining+ because it requires another value to generate its own value. We list these *dependent keys* inside the +property()+ declaration.

We've also bound the view's +remaining+ property to the +todoListController+'s +remaining+ property. This means that, because of the dependency chain we've described, if +Todos.todoListController.remaining+ changes, +displayRemaining+ will automatically update.

When we have information that views need but is based on aggregate information about our models, the array controller is a good place to put it. Let's add a new computed property to +todoListController+ in +todos.js+:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating previous code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  remaining: function() {
    return this.filterProperty('isDone', false).get('length');
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

Here, we specify our dependent key using +@each+. This allows us to depend on properties of the array's items. In this case, we want to update the +remaining+ property any time +isDone+ changes on a +Todo+.

NOTE: The +@each+ property also updates when an item is added or removed.

It's important to declare dependent keys because SproutCore uses this information to know when to update bindings. In our case, our +StatsView+ updates any time +todoListController+'s +remaining+ property changes.

Here's how it all fits together:

<div style='text-align: center'>
  !images/html_based/bindings.png!
</div>

INFO: As we build up our application, we create *declarative* links between objects. These links describe how application state flows from the model layer to the HTML in the presentation layer.

h3. Clearing Completed Todos

As we populate our list with todos, we may want to periodically clear out those we've completed. As you have learned, we will want to make that change to the +todoListController+, and let SproutCore automatically propagate those changes to the DOM.

Let's add a new +clearCompletedTodos+ method to the controller.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  clearCompletedTodos: function() {
    this.filterProperty('isDone', true).forEach(this.removeObject, this);
  }
});
</javascript>

Next, we'll add the HTML to our template and connect it up to a view for event handling. Open +todos.handlebars+ and add a button inside the HTML for +statsView+:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- updating existing code -->

{{#view Todos.StatsView id="stats"}}
  {{#view Todos.ClearCompletedView classBinding="isActive"}}
    Clear Completed Todos
  {{/view}}
  {{displayRemaining}} remaining.
{{/view}}
</html>

Now implement +Todos.ClearCompletedView+:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.ClearCompletedView = SC.TemplateView.extend({  
  classNames: ['button'],
 
  // Setting isActive to true will trigger the classBinding and add
  // 'is-active' to our layer's class names.
  mouseDown: function() {
    this.set('isActive', true);
  },
 
  // Setting isActive to false will remove 'is-active' from our
  // layer's class names.
  mouseUp: function() {
    this.set('isActive', false);
    Todos.todoListController.clearCompletedTodos();
  }
});
</javascript>

Fire up your browser and try it out. Add some todos, then mark them done and clear them.  Because we previously bound the visual list to the +todoListController+, making a change through new means has the expected effect.

h3. Marking All as Done

Let's say you've decided to lay off the hooch for a day and actually get all of your work done. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to easily mark every todo as complete?

It turns out that, due to our application's declarative nature, all the hard work is already done. We just need a way to mark every +Todo+ complete.

Let's first create a new computed property on our controller that describes whether or not every todo is done. It might look something like this:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  allAreDone: function() {
    return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

INFO: SproutCore has many enumerable helpers. +everyProperty('isDone', true)+ returns true if every item in the array has an +isDone+ property that evaluates to +true+. You can find the full list of helpers in "SC.Enumerable":http://edgedocs.sproutcore.com/symbols/SC.Enumerable.html.

Next, we'll create a checkbox to mark all items complete and bind it to this property:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- at the end of the file -->

{{#view Todos.MarkAllDoneView}}
  <label>
    <input class="mark-all-done" type="checkbox"> Mark All as Done
  </label>
{{/view}}
</html>

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// at the end of the file

Todos.MarkAllDoneView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  classNames: ['checkbox'],

  valueBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.allAreDone'
});
</javascript>

If you reload your browser and use the app, you'll notice that clicking all of the checkboxes of your todos will cause the "Mark All as Done" checkbox to become checked. However, it doesn't work in the other direction: clicking "Mark All as Done" has no effect.

So far, our computed properties have described how to calculate a value from dependent properties. In this case, we want to accept a new value, and update dependent properties to reflect it.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  allAreDone: function(key, value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
      this.setEach('isDone', value);
      return value;
    } else {
      return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
    }
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

When you set a computed property, your function is called with the property key as the first parameter and the new value as the second. To determine if SproutCore is asking for the value or trying to set it, we examine the +value+ parameter. If it is defined, we iterate through each +Todo+ and set its +isDone+ property to the new value.

Because bindings are bidirectional, SproutCore will set +allAreDone+ to +true+ when the user clicks the "Mark All as Done" checkbox. Conversely, unchecking it will make SproutCore set +allAreDone+ to +false+, unchecking all todos.

Reload the app and add some todos. Click "Mark All as Done". Wow! Each of the individual check boxes gets checked off. If you uncheck one of them, the "Mark All as Done" checkbox unchecks itself.  When you use SproutCore, as you scale your UI, you never need to wonder whether a new feature will work consistently with parts of the UI you already implemented. Because you build your view layer to simply reflect the state of your models, you can make changes however you want and see them update automatically.
