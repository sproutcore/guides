h5. setup

h5. teardown

h5. runloop

NOTE: runloop doesn't exist yet.

What +runloop+ will do is provide a test function that will
wrap code needing to be within a +SC.RunLoop+.  This will mitigate problems when
an exception is inadvertently thrown within the code between +SC.RunLoop.begin+ and
+SC.RunLoop.end+ by guaranteeing that the +SC.RunLoop.end+ is called regardless.  This will
help find the cause easier as well as help the developer not forget to include the +SC.RunLoop.end+ call.
