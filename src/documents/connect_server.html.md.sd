WARNING: This is a Draft Copy, and although the information in here is
correct, it may be incomplete in places.

### When you have a light app, with limited server needs

SproutCore includes a powerful model layer, called the datastore. SproutCore
has special code in it's controller and view layers to make the datastore the
most efficient source of data.

Nevertheless, you don't have to use the datastore in your application. Like
most high-quality frameworks, the datastore is an optional framework in
SproutCore (though it is "on" by default).

If you come from a jQuery (or other JS framework), you're probably used to
making your own AJAX calls and handling the response yourself. Toolkits like
[BackBone](http://backbonejs.org/) work like this. If you
have a small app, and feel more comfortable with this approach:

Follow along with the [Using a server without the store](no_store.html) Guide.

### Using the Store

However, if you are going to deal with more than a handful of data, or want to
take advantage of relationships between data, then managing it all on your own
quickly gets messy. One of SproutCore's strongest features is it's Data Store.
The Store can hold all of your data in memory allowing you to search through
it with [Queries](records.html#using-queries). It is also the central place
for your data, allowing you to bind many different views to the same record
and have changes propagated easily.

Connecting your store to a server can be one of the most daunting tasks in
creating your app:

* How do I know when to send a message to the server? 
* Do I have to rewrite my server?

There are some different choices depending on what setup you already have (if
any).

#### When you have an existing, server-based MVC app

If you are coming to SproutCore with a server side app that you already have
running, the fastest way of getting going is to contact your server and update
the store to match based on the response. For example, if you want to update a
record in the store, you would ask the server to update the record and when the
update is successful, you would update the store locally.

This is possible because SproutCore's datastore framework allows for nested
stores. With a nested store, edits are "buffered" in the nested store. You
would send the changes in the nested store to the server, and when it
responds, update the base store and clear (or destroy) the nested store.

This makes your "base" store a read-only copy of the server. You can push new
data from the server into the base store at any time, update existing data, or
delete data. Any *changes* to data are made in a nested store where they can
easily be aborted or cleared.

This puts the server 100% in control of the "base" store. There are techniques
to keep your base store easily up to date, and to refresh parts of the store
when needed. Very sophisticated apps can be built with this approach, and it
is the most appropriate way to build a SproutCore application if you already
have an existing server-based MVC app.

_We will have a guide for this soon._

The downside to this approach is that your app will have to wait on responses
from the server, meaning that you don't have a truly responsive user
experience. See the next section if this is a concern.

#### When you are building a new SproutCore app from scratch, without an existing server

The final approach puts a SproutCore datastore in 100% control.

This method of connecting to the server is to use SproutCore's default method
of a DataSource. The Store is designed to interact with the DataSource,
letting it know when things have changed. When using a data source you can
treat your Store like a local copy of your server. You can ask for records,
save records or create records directly in the store, and your dataSource will
then take care of propogating these changes to your server.

This method will give you the most interactive setup, allowing your user to
keep clicking, and not have to wait on your servers responses before moving
on. If your going for the best user experience in an app, this is the way to
go.

Have a look at the [Connecting With a DataSource](data_source.html) Guide.
