### Introduction

Animations play an important role when engineering an application.  They allow
a stagnant set of states and views to become fluid with movement.  When used
tactfully, these visual effects can be used to create seamless transitions
between views, provide 3D space to a flat view or object, or help draw
attention to a specific part of your application.  The possibilities are
endless with +SC.View#animate+.

####  What is SC.View#animate?

+SC.View#animate+ is a set of features and functionality that makes it easy to
build compelling user interfaces. It animates the properties of a view.  You'll
need to think about three things when applying an animation:  The type of
animation you'd like to apply, the duration in seconds needed to complete the
animation, and how smoothly the animations move between frames. 

####  What are the features of SC.View#animate?

+SC.View#animate+ uses CSS3 animations and javascript as a fallback when
needed.  Animations can be combined with multiple types, synchronized and
executed at once or executed concurrently.  When using +SC.View#animate+, the
property of a view animates and changes without redrawing the view.  Therefore,
the views properties change during the animation.

WARNING: The JavaScript fallback has not yet been implemented.

####  What are the benefits of SC.View#animate?

Using +SC.View#animate+ has many benefits.  By using CSS-only timing functions
of the animations before falling back to JavaScript, allows JavaScript
performance to not be impacted.  When JavaScript handles the timing functions
it has to do some semi-heavy calculations each frame.  Using CSS-only timing
functions gives a graceful degradation of sorts.  This approach allows your
application to be cross-browser compliant and have optimized performance.

Furthermore, combing multiple types of animations on one view allows you to
step outside of the preset effects and enables you to create custom effects.
While synchronizing multiple views to animate at once enables your application
to become cinematic or a presentation of sorts.  

And last, when used with a callback method your animations can become
concurrent and fluid.  We will explore the aforementioned features and benefits
of +SC.View#animate+ through practical, real-world scenarios towards the end of
this guide.  But before we do so lets have a detailed look at +SC.View#animate+.

### A detailed look

To start with we will explore the syntax for +SC.View#animate+.  Below is a
basic animation that fades a views opacity from +1.0+ down to +0.0+.  The
duration for how long it takes for the animation to take place is 1.5 seconds
and the timing is eased in then out.

```javascript
myApp.myView.animate('opacity', 0.0, {
  duration:1.5,
  timing:'ease-in-out'
});
```

#### Type of animation effects

After you set which view you would like to animate, the first parameter passed
is the type of animation effect you would like to use.  The following is a list
of what animation effects you can use:

##### +opacity+

Opacity has a value of +0.0 - 1.0+.  The value assigned is that of a
percentage.  Therefore, +0.6+ is setting a views opacity to +60%+ transparency.
Opacity is a great way to switch between two views that are stacked on each
other. 

##### +scale+

Scale has a value of +0.0 - infinite+.  The value assigned is that of a
percentage.  Therefore, +2.0+ is setting a views height and width 200% larger
then its defined properties in your view.  Scale allows you to create bounce
effects and explore the 3d plane through the z axis.

##### +top+ / +bottom+ / +left+ / +right+ / +height+ / +width+

+top+, +bottom+, +left+, +right+, +height+, and +width+ changes the value of
each property in your layout.  In order to use +top+, +bottom+, +left+, and/or
+right+, the view in which you are animating must be assigned those values.
The value assign is that of a pixel.  Therefore, if you have a view with a
value of +'left:10'+ assign to the left property and within your animation you
adjust the properties value to +'left:100'+ then the view will glide to the
newly assigned +left+ value.

##### +rotateX+ / +rotateY+ / +rotateZ+

+rotateX+, +rotateY+, and +rotateZ+ allows you to change a views position
within a 3d plane.  Below is a graph showing how X, Y, and Z interact with a 3d
plane.

<div style='text-align: center'> ![XYZ Rotation](images/animate/xyz.png) </div>

#### Duration of an animation

The second parameter passed is pretty straight forward and is the duration of
the animations effect. It has a value of seconds.

#### Timing of an animation

The third parameter passed relates to the animations timing.  More
specifically, it allows for animations to change their speed over its duration.
The values assigned to timing is preset and determined based on what timing
option you pass. 

##### +linear+

The +linear+ animation timing function provides and straight-line interpolation
between the starting value and the final animated value assigned to your view.

<div style='text-align: center'> ![Linear Graph](images/animate/linear_graph.png) </div>

##### +ease-in+

The +ease-in+ animation timing function allows the animation to start slow, get
faster and faster as the animation plays out, and finally become constant
again.  However, the constant state occurs faster than a basic curve would be.

+ease-in+ starts with a shallow slope during the start of the animation.
During this part of the animation the animated value does not change much, but
as time goes on, the animated value starts to change more quickly until the
final value is achieved.  This timing function provides the user with a subtle
cue and allows the user time to adjust or acknowledge the fact that something
is changing.  Furthermore, with the animations speed dramatically increasing
towards the end, the visual cue places an emphasis on the achieved state of the
animated property value.  

<div style='text-align: center'> ![Ease In Graph](images/animate/ease_in_graph.png) </div>   

##### +ease-out+

The +ease-out+ animation is the opposite of ease-in.  Instead of starting slow
and speeding up, the +ease-out+ timing starts off fast and slows down till the
animated value is reached.  This timing function provides the user with a cue
that draws their attention to the initial change and gives an emphasis to the
start of the animation and less to the ending.

<div style='text-align: center'> ![Ease Out Graph](images/animate/ease_out_graph.png) </div>  

##### +ease-in-out+

The +ease-in-out+ timing function starts off slowly, accelerates in the middle,
and then slows down again towards the end.  This animation, much like its name
describes, is a combination between +ease-in+ and +ease-out+.  The cue provided
with +ease-in-out+ gives more emphasis on the middle of the animation and less
towards the beginning and ending.

### Using +SC.View#animate+:

#### Adding animations to an existing application

_TODO: Here we can have a developer grab an existing application from git and
add the animations to the app.  By having the developer use an existing
application allows us to walk a developer through with minimal distraction and
adds an emphasis to the topic at hand... animations._

#### Example animation one: animating buttons on a navigation menu

_TODO: Here we will focus only on the animations part of our application.  The
code example shown in the guides will only be the animations._

#### Example animation two:  animating views for touch enabled devices

_TODO: We would like to show how to use animations with touch enabled devices,
such as a drill down listview for mobile devices or for a tablets navigation
menu and navigating through views with a swipe on a tablet._

#### Example animation three: using animation in a 3d plane

_TODO: Here we can have some fun and introduce the developer to animating on a
3d plane.  This part of animations is great for creating splash pages, and
ads._
