### Key-Value Observing

One of the core tenets of a SproutCore application is leveraging SproutCore's
Key-Value Observing (KVO) system.  KVO is a powerful feature that keeps code
clean, fast and maintainable.  Rather than writing fallible code to manually
keep your application in sync between models, views and other objects, we
simply define and bind the proper properties and let SproutCore magically
update the state of our application as these properties change.

#### get() and set()

For KVO to work properly, SproutCore implements getters and setters to track
changes to objects. This is why it's important to always use +get()+ and
+set()+ for properties that might use observers, bindings, or be computed
properties. Failure to do so will cause your app to get out of sync and not
update properly.  While this may seem like a nuisance for those used to
accessing everything via dot notation, the benefits of KVO are substantial and
you'll quickly get used to using `get()` and `set()` such
that you'll forget you ever had to worry about it.

The following example shows KVO compliant access to an SC.Object object.

```javascript
var obj = SC.Object.create({ name: 'Jim' });
obj.get('name'); // Jim
obj.set('name', 'Bob');
obj.get('name'); // Bob
```

INFO: Those of you who have worked in languages like Java may be familiar with
having to write property accessors. Instead of having to define accessors for
every property, +get()+ and +set()+ serve as universal accessors.

#### Property Paths

SproutCore also introduces the concept of property paths, which will play a
role in the next important sections. A +property path+ is a String that points
to a nested property. For instance, `"MyApp.userController.firstName"` refers
to the `firstName` property of the `MyApp.userController` object. You can also
have relative paths which refer to paths relative to the current object. For
instance, within the context of `MyApp`, you could use the path
`".userController.firstName"` to point to the same location. As you can see,
the relative property begins with a period, which is always the case for
relative property paths.

To work with relative property paths you can use the +getPath()+ and
+setPath()+ functions. These work identically to `get()` and `set()` except
that they expect a path as the first argument.

### Computed Properties

Often you have properties that depend on the value of several other properties.
These are known as computed properties and they are an extremely useful means
to keep your code contextually correct without resorting to manual property
manipulation. Computed properties are defined as functions with a call to
+property()+ using a list of the dependent property names or property paths as
arguments.

In the next example, we will revisit an earlier version of `MyApp.Person`, to
make the `fullName()` function into a computed property.

```javascript
MyApp.Person = SC.Object.extend({
  firstName: null,
  lastName:  null,

  fullName: function() {
    return [this.get('firstName'), this.get('lastName')].compact().join(' ');
  }.property('firstName', 'lastName')
});

var person = MyApp.Person.create({
  firstName: 'Peter',
  lastName:  'Wagenet'
});

person.get('fullName'); // Peter Wagenet
person.set('lastName', 'Smith');
person.get('fullName'); // Peter Smith
```

As you can see, you are able to use `get()` with computed properties in the
same way you would use it with regular properties.

This may not seem like much of an improvement over the previous `fullName()`
function, but it is, or at least it will be.  On the one hand, by making
`fullName` into a property it can now be observed and bound to, an important
detail which is described later, but on the other hand SproutCore provides a
function to make computed properties even more efficient for our use right now.
This is where the +cacheable()+ extension comes in.  By making our computed
properties cacheable, they don't need to be computed _unless their dependent
properties change_.

The next example highlights how multiple requests of the same property don't
involve re-calculations. Notice the addition of `cacheable()` to the computed
property.

```javascript
MyApp.Person = SC.Object.extend({
  firstName: null,
  lastName:  null,

  fullName: function() {
    console.log('Calculating fullName...');
    return [this.get('firstName'), this.get('lastName')].compact().join(' ');
  }.property('firstName', 'lastName').cacheable()
});

var person = MyApp.Person.create({
  firstName: 'Peter',
  lastName:  'Wagenet'
});

person.get('fullName');
> 'Calculating fullName...' // Peter Wagenet
person.get('fullName');   // Peter Wagenet
person.set('lastName', 'Smith');
person.get('fullName');
> 'Calculating fullName...' // Peter Smith
```

NOTE: Computed properties are "lazily" computed.  That is, their functions are
not run _until_ the property is requested.  If the computed property is never
requested, the function will never need be run.

Setting computed properties is slightly more complicated, but still easy to
grasp. Each call to `set()` passes +key+ and +value+ arguments to the computed
property function, while a call to `get()` on the same computed property will
only pass the `key` and the `value` will be `undefined`.  Therefore, the
existence of `value` tells us whether the property is being got or set.

Here is an example of creating a computed property that is also writable with
`set()`.

```javascript
MyApp.Capitalizer = SC.Object.extend({
  capitalizedValue: function(key, value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
      this._capitalizedValue = value.toUpperCase();
      console.log('Set capitalizedValue to ' + this._capitalizedValue);
    }
    return this._capitalizedValue;
  }.property()
});

var cap = MyApp.Capitalizer.create();
cap.set('capitalizedValue', 'abc');
> 'Set capitalizedValue to ABC'
cap.get('capitalizedValue'); // 'ABC'
```

The `key` argument is ignored, which is generally the case with computed
properties.

### Observers

Closely related to the concept of properties is that of observers. Observers do
exactly what their name suggests, they observe properties, watching for
changes. The most basic observer looks like this,

```javascript
var obj = SC.Object.create({
  value: null,
  valueDidUpdate: function(){
    alert('New Value: ' + this.get('value'));
  }.observes('value')
});

obj.set('value', 'Test'); // alert('New Value: Test');
```

As you can see +observes()+ is added to the function and when the matching
property is updated, the function is run. You can even pass multiple properties
or property paths into an observer.

The following example uses an observer on a property and a computed property.
This is actually an example of an improper use of `observes()`, because
`fullName` is dependent on `firstName` and `lastName` and therefore also
appears to change whenever one of those properties changes.  Therefore, it
probably doesn't make sense to observe both `fullName` and `firstName`, but it
helps us to really understand how computed properties and observers work.

```javascript
MyApp.Person = SC.Object.extend({
  firstName: null,
  lastName: null,
  fullName: function() {
    console.log('Calculating fullName...');
    return [this.get('firstName'), this.get('lastName')].compact().join(' ');
  }.property('firstName', 'lastName').cacheable(),

  nameDidChange: function() {
    console.log('firstName or fullName changed!');
  }.observes('firstName','fullName')
});

person = MyApp.Person.create({
  firstName: 'Emma',
  lastName: 'Goldman'
});

person.set('lastName','Berkman');
> 'firstName or fullName changed!' // because fullName will have changed
person.set('firstName','Alexander');
> 'firstName or fullName changed!' // because firstName changed
> 'firstName or fullName changed!' // because fullName will have changed
```

NOTE: Note that `fullName` properly notifies changing as `firstName` and
`lastName` change, but it is still not re-computed in this example because we
didn't actually `get()` `fullName` anywhere.

INFO: Using `set()` to repeatedly set the same value will not result in the
observer firing repeatedly.  It will only fire when the value changes.

#### Observer Notification

It is important to realize that observers have to be notified of property
changes. The `set()` method and `property()` extension handles this for us
automatically, which is one of the reasons `get()` and `set()` should be used
to access properties. However, there are rare cases where we know that an
observed property has changed without having updated the KVO system. In these
cases you can use +notifyPropertyChange()+ to tell observers that the property
has been updated (i.e. `this.notifyPropertyChange('value')`).  However, if you
find this is the case, check your code to see that you are using `set()` and
that your computed properties have the correct dependent properties defined.

Another case that is less rare is that you may find that you are updating a
number of properties at once. If you have a lot of observers that depend on
these properties, you may find them getting called more often than necessary.
In this case, you can use +beginPropertyChanges()+ and +endPropertyChanges()+
to wrap your property change calls. This will cause all change notifications to
happen once +endPropertyChanges+ is called and will prevent unnecessary
duplicate notifications.

#### Chained Property Paths

Observers are able to use a special type of property path called a +chained
property path+. When using an observer (or a binding as we will see), usually
the actual observer is only added to the _second to last object_ in the
property path. Therefore, if you add an observer for the path
`"MyApp.usersController.mainUser.name"`, SproutCore finds the object at
`"MyApp.usersController.mainUser"` and adds the observer to its `name`
property. In this case, nothing is observing `MyApp.usersController` to see if
its `mainUser` property changes.

For example,

```javascript
MyApp.usersController = SC.Object.create({
  mainUser: SC.Object.create({
    name: 'Joe'
  })
});

MyApp.observerObject = SC.Object.create({
  userNameDidChange: function() {
    console.log(this.getPath('MyApp.usersController.mainUser.name'));
  }.observes('MyApp.usersController.mainUser.name')
});

MyApp.usersController.setPath('mainUser.name', 'Jim');
> 'Jim'
MyApp.usersController.set('mainUser', SC.Object.create({ name: 'Bob' }));
MyApp.usersController.setPath('mainUser.name', 'Doug');
```

As you can see, when we replace `mainUser` the observer does not fire. This is
because we only had an observer on the original `mainUser` object, which has
been replaced.

What we want to do is watch for changes to `usersController.mainUser` and for
changes to `mainUser.name`. This is where chained property paths come in. To
let SproutCore know that we want observers on both, we use a chained property
path like `MyApp.usersController*mainUser.name`.

The asterisk (*) in the property path indicates that we want SproutCore to
observe changes to all properties _following_ the asterisk. In this case, that
is both `mainUser` and `name`.

Here's an updated version of the previous example with a chained observer,

```javascript
MyApp.observerObject = SC.Object.create({
  userNameDidChange: function() {
    console.log(this.getPath('MyApp.usersController.mainUser.name'));
  }.observes('MyApp.usersController*mainUser.name') // Chained observer
});

MyApp.usersController.setPath('mainUser.name', 'Jim');
> 'Jim'
MyApp.usersController.set('mainUser', SC.Object.create({ name: 'Bob' }));
> 'Bob'
```

The observer will now fire if `MyApp.usersController.mainUser.name` or
`MyApp.usersController.mainUser` changes.

So why don't we always use chained observers?  Observers are "expensive", they
take time to set up and they have to run each time their properties change and
often times we don't have changes in all levels. In the previous example, we
don't care about changes to `MyApp.usersController`, because we are never going
to replace it.  If the same were true for `mainUser`, we wouldn't want to
observe it either. Therefore, it is advisable in practice to use chained
observers as little as possible, in order to protect performance.

### Bindings

When you combine properties and observers, you end up with +bindings+. Bindings
serve to link two properties together and if you have experience with other
application development frameworks, you will likely recognize their importance.

Here is an example which binds a property on an SC.View object to a property on
a controller object.  SC.View is the main SproutCore view class and it is a
common pattern to bind views to controllers, so that as properties change on
the controller, the view updates automatically.  This example uses the short
form of creating a binding, by simply suffixing +Binding+ to the property name.

```javascript
MyApp.userController = SC.Object.create({
  name: null
});

MyApp.mainView = SC.View.create({
  userBinding: 'MyApp.userController.name'
});

MyApp.userController.set('name', 'Joe');

// The runloop must run

console.log(MyApp.mainView.get('user'));
> 'Joe'

MyApp.mainView.set('user', 'Jim');

// The runloop must run

console.log(MyApp.userController.get('name'));
> 'Jim'
```

NOTE: In this example, we used the absolute path to the property. Bindings
support relative property paths and chained property paths as well.

As you can see in the example, when you update the value on one side of the
relationship, it is automatically updated on the other side and vice versa. By
default bindings are bi-directional, but you can also set them to only go in
one direction by using the long form +SC.Binding.oneWay()+ setup instead.
Making bindings unidirectional increases the performance of the binding and is
recommended.

INFO: The long form for a bi-directional binding is `SC.Binding.from()`.

For example, if we used `userBinding: SC.Binding.oneWay('MyApp.userController.name')`,
changes to `MyApp.userController.name` would update `MyApp.mainView.user`, but
setting `MyApp.mainView.user` will not update `MyApp.userController.name`.

```javascript
MyApp.userController = SC.Object.create({
  name: null
});

MyApp.mainView = SC.View.create({
  userBinding: SC.Binding.oneWay('MyApp.userController.name')
});

MyApp.userController.set('name', 'Joe');

// The runloop must run

console.log(MyApp.mainView.get('user'));
> 'Joe'

MyApp.mainView.set('user', 'Jim');

// The runloop must run

console.log(MyApp.userController.get('name'));
> 'Joe'
```

NOTE: One very important difference between bindings and observers is that
observers update almost immediately, while bindings update once at the end of
each Run Loop. By deferring binding updates, it offers considerable
improvements in performance, but can be confusing if you are expecting an
update to propagate immediately.  See ‘The Run Loop’ for more details.

#### Bindings and Chained Property Paths

Since bindings are based off of observers behind the scenes, the same
principles of chained observers applies. This means that if you want to bind a
chained property path, you will want to use asterisks in your path as
appropriate.

For example,

```javascript
MyApp.usersController = SC.Object.create({
  mainUser: SC.Object.create({
    name: 'Joe'
  })
});

MyApp.userNameView = SC.LabelView.create({
  valueBinding: 'MyApp.usersController*mainUser.name'
});

MyApp.usersController.setPath('mainUser.name', 'Harriet');

// The run loop must run

console.log(MyApp.userNameView.get('value'));
> 'Harriet'

MyApp.usersController.set('mainUser', SC.Object.create({ name: 'Eunice' }));

// The run loop must run

console.log(MyApp.userNameView.get('value'));
> 'Eunice'
```

Since we used an asterisk in the property path, the binding will be updated
when either `mainUser` or `mainUser.name` changes.

#### Binding Transforms

By default, Sproutcore creates simple bi-directional bindings.  A change on one
property will be relayed to the other side and vice versa with no changes in
between.  Sometimes, this behavior isn't exactly what you want.  For example,
what if you have an object that expects a Boolean on one side and another
object that emits a Number on the other side?

Sproutcore provides an way to implement custom bindings through *binding
transforms*.  Transforms convert values that change on one side of the bindings
into another value before it is applied to the other side.

|_. Helper |_. Description |
|oneWay()|Forces binding to only relay changes in one direction.  Changes on the "from" side (the path you name as the value) will be relayed to the "to" side (the property you name before "Binding").  Changes in the other direction will not be relayed. |
|bool()|Forces all values to become booleans.  +null+, +undefined+, +0+, and +false+ all become +false+.  All other values become +true+ |
|single()|Forces all values to a non-Enumerable value.  Arrays with one item in them will be converted to that item only.  Arrays with multiple items will be converted to a placeholder value (default +SC.MULTIPLE_PLACEHOLDER+).|
|multiple()|Forces all values to an Array-like value.  +null+ or +undefined+ becomes an empty array.  Single objects will be wrapped in an array.  Arrays and enumerables pass through unchanged.|
|notEmpty()|Does not allow empty values.  +null+, +undefined+, empty strings and empty arrays are converted to a placeholder value (default +SC.EMPTY_PLACEHOLDER+)|
|notNull()|Does not allow +null+ values.  This is a more restricted version of notEmpty()|
|not()|Inverts the transform.  This is equivalent to +bool()+ but the resulting boolean will be inverted.|
|isNull()|Transforms the value to +YES+ if the original value is +null+ or +undefined+ and +NO+ otherwise.  Useful for enabled/disabling UI when you have no content|
|noError()|Ensures no Error objects are allowed through.  Errors will be converted to +null+.|

Transforms can be chained together.  You can use this facility to construct
just the type of binding you want.  For example, if you have an object that
expects single values only, no errors and no empty values, you could code:
 
```javascript
userBinding: SC.Binding.from('MyApp.userController.name'.single().noError().notEmpty()
```

As another example, if you only need a one way binding that is of a boolean
type, you could code:

```javascript
isVisibleBinding: SC.Binding.from('MyApp.userController.isBusy").oneWay().bool()
```

In addition to using the built-in transforms listed above, you can also add
your own transforms.  A transform is simply a function that accepts an
untransformed value and returns the transformed value.  It has the following
signature.

```javascript
function(value, isForward) {
  // do transform
  return transformedValue;
}
```

The first parameter passed to a transform function will be the untransformed
+value+.  

If +isForward+ is +YES+, then the value being passed came from the "from" side
of the binding (i.e. the "Binding.path" you named).  If +isForward+ is +NO+,
then the value came from the "to" side (i.e. the property you named with
"propertyBinding").  You can vary your transform behavior if you are based on
the direction of the change.

Your transform function should transform the value as needed and return it.  If
you don't want to perform any kind of transform, then return the value as it
was passed in.

For example, to make a string upper case:

```javascript
userBinding: SC.Binding.from('MyApp.userController.name')
  .transform(function(value, isForward) {
    return (value && value.toString) ? value.toString().toUpperCase() : '';
  })
```

If you want use a transform over and over again, you can define a new method on
the +SC.Binding+ object like so:

```javascript
SC.Binding.upperCaseString = function() {
  return this.transform(function(value, isForward) {
    return (value && value.toString) ? value.toString().toUpperCase() : '';
  });
};

...

userBinding: SC.Binding.from('MyApp.userController.name'.upperCaseString())

```


#### Manually Creating and Disconnecting Bindings

Most of the time you will setup bindings using the class definition method
described above.  Occasionally, however, you may want to setup and teardown
bindings yourself.  
 
To create a binding just use the +bind()+ method defined on +SC.Observable+ and
inherited by +SC.Object+.  The first parameter you pass should be the property
name you want to bind to.  The second is the same thing you would set as the
value of a binding property:
 
```javascript
myView.bind('isVisible', SC.Binding.from('MyApp.mainController.title').bool());
 
// is the same as
 
myView = SC.View.create({
  isVisibleBinding: SC.Binding.from('MyApp.mainController.title').bool()
});
```
 
Note that when you manually create a binding, the +BindingDefaults+ property is
not consulted.  You must configure the binding exactly as you need.

If you have created a binding and need to disconnect it for some reason, you
can call the +disconnect()+ method on the binding itself.

If you manually create a binding using bind(), the actual binding object is
returned from the bind() call.

If you create a binding by defining it on your class, you can find the binding
instance on the same property on an object instance:

```javascript
var binding = myView.bind('isVisible', SC.Binding.from('MyApp.mainController.title').bool());
 
// is the same as
 
myView = SC.View.create({
  isVisibleBinding: SC.Binding.form('MyApp.mainController.title').bool()
});
var binding = myView.get('isVisibleBinding');
 
// disconnect!
binding.disconnect();
```

You can reconnect a binding that has been disconnected using the +connect()+
method as well.
