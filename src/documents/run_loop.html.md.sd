### The Run Loop

The Run Loop coordinates all the events within your application, which includes
primarily flushing bindings when observers update. This helps make sure that
events stay synchronized and run at the proper times. One of the main ways this
will affect your application is that bindings do not propagate unless a Run
Loop runs.  Also, Views will only render updates once per Run Loop, thus
avoiding unnecessarily touching the DOM.  This keeps display updates extremely
fast even if many properties are changing per Run Loop.

SproutCore manages the Run Loop for you, automatically starting a Run Loop when
it receives any browser events or user input. The only case in which you will
have to manage the Run Loop from within your app is _if you have a callback
from an external library that is not managed by SproutCore_. In this
circumstance, you will want to trigger a new Run Loop by wrapping the code in
+SC.run()+. This will create a new Run Loop for that bit of code and will make
sure your application continues to update as expected.

Here is an example of triggering a Run Loop when a Web Worker message event is
fired.

```javascript
worker = new Worker(path);

worker.onmessage = function(event) {
  SC.run(function() {
    // Do something
  });
};
```

NOTE: See +SC.Event.addEvent()+ for a SproutCore compatible way to add
the `message` event listener in the example above.

#### Using the Run Loop in Unit Tests

When working with unit tests, you will also have situations where you need to
force bindings and observers to update so that you can check for the correct
results. In these cases, it is completely legitimate to manually invoke the Run
Loop. Normally user events would trigger the Run Loop, but since your tests are
automated, there are no user events taking place.

You may also find that when you are working in your browser's JavaScript
console that, when you set a variable, your application's interface doesn't
update as you expect. This may be caused by a Run Loop not firing (since you
aren't interacting directly with the application no events are being
triggered). In this case you should try invoking the Run Loop manually or just
move your mouse over the application to trigger a new event.

WARNING: Remember, you rarely need to manage the Run Loop manually from within
your application. If you aren't certain of why you are forcing a new Run Loop,
then you may be doing something wrong.

### The Run Loop Methods: invokeLast(), invokeOnce(), invokeNext()

SC.RunLoop provides three methods for greater control over the execution of
code within a Run Loop: +invokeOnce()+, +invokeLast()+ and +invokeNext()+.  All
methods take the same parameters, a +target+ and a +method+ and, depending on
which function is used, the method is called on the target at a specific point
in the Run Loop.

The following describes the execution order: 

  * functions passed to +invokeOnce()+ are run at the beginning of the current Run Loop,
  * functions passed to +invokeLast()+ are run at the end of the current Run Loop, and
  * functions passed to +invokeNext()+ are run at the very beginning of the _next_ Run Loop.

INFO: You will likely never call these methods on SC.RunLoop itself, since
there are matching convenience methods defined on SC.Object (i.e. in any
subclass of SC.Object you can call +this.invokeLater(method)+).

To best illustrate the different stages of the Run Loop, see the following
diagram.

![Run Loop Diagram](images/run_loop_diagram.jpg)

You will notice the recursive "More changes?" stages.  These exist because each
time a wave of changes is propagated, it may cause several additional observers
to fire and more code to be run.  The Run Loop keeps flushing these waves of
changes until everything is stable, thus demonstrating another key benefit of
using Run Loops; that at the end of each Run Loop and before the next event,
the application's state is guaranteed to be stabilized.

Here are some typical usage scenarios for each of the Run Loop methods:

* If you have a function that could be called from multiple places, but you
  only want it to execute once no matter how many times it was referenced,
  use +invokeOnce()+.
* If you have a function that you want to run after all bindings have flushed
  and after views have updated, use +invokeLast()+.
* If you have a function that you want to defer entirely, such as a View paint,
  use +invokeNext()+.

Therefore, as the previous usage scenarios suggest, you will not typically find
the need to use any of these methods.  The most common exception is that you
may occasionally use invokeLast() to ensure that your Views have rendered
before doing some operation on dependent on their rendered output, such as an
animation.

NOTE: If you add the same +target+ and +method+ pair multiple times to any of
these functions, it will still only be executed once.
