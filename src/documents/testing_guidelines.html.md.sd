sc_description: This guide covers using test-driven development (TDD) techniques to develop SproutCore applications.  After reading this guide, you will be able to:
sc_list:
  - Write tests for methods to be implemented and use them to help you implement them.
  - Write tests to verify that your observers fire when you expect them to.
  - Write tests that verify your bindings fire when you expect them to and how to incorporate +SC.RunLoop+ so that they will function.
  - <em>TODO</em> - more
