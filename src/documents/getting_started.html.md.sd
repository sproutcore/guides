sc_list:
  - Install SproutCore on your machine.
  - Use the SproutCore tools to generate a basic starting application.
  - Run the SproutCore development server to test your application.
  - Modify the application to ensure that changes are visible.

### Introduction

The introductory "Getting Started" guides pages are step-by-step treatments of concepts needed to make a full
SproutCore application.

This first "Getting Started" guide will ensure that you have the latest version of Sproutcore installed and
configured properly. If you run into any issues or bumps along the way, please reach out on the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore), find us on IRC at #sproutcore or leave a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sproutcore/sproutcore)!

### Installation

To install the SproutCore development environment you need to have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM installed.
The latest version of NodeJS currently supported by this environment is 9.x.

Please visit the [Installation Page](http://sproutcore.com/install/) and follow the guide for your platform.

Great! Now that SproutCore is installed, we can move forward and get our first app up-and-running!

### Creating A New SproutCore Application

When you are first learning any new language or framework, it is generally a good idea to create a separate
directory to store all of your code. So, in some area of your hard drive where you develop software, make a
sproutcore directory.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/development/sproutcore
```

NOTE: The dollar sign ($) in the code above and below represents the command line prompt and should not
be typed when executing the commands. Lines without a prompt generally show you the output of the previous
command.

This directory can serve as a place for all things SproutCore. Change directory to `~/development/sproutcore`, then
create a SproutCore project:

```bash
$ cd ~/development/sproutcore
$ sproutcore init getting_started
  Your project has been successfully created!
$ cd getting_started
```

Now you have a getting_started project directory, ~/development/sproutcore/getting_started. We will build
several SproutCore apps in this project space, but for now, we'll just create a basic "Hello World" style application
to ensure that everything is installed and working properly.

Create the app in the getting_started project directory:

```bash
$ sproutcore gen app TodosOne
  App TodosOne generated
```

Your directory structure should now look like the following:


  * **getting_started/**
    * **sc_config**
    * **apps/**
      * **TodosOne/**
        * **sc_config**
        * **core.js**
        * **main.js**
        * **theme.js**
        * **statechart.js**
        * **controllers/**
        * **fixtures/**
        * **views/**
        * **states/**
          * **ready_state.js**
        * **resources/**
          * **_theme.css**
          * **loading.ejs**
          * **main_page.js**
          * **main_page.css**

### Explanation

When you are building a web application in SproutCore, it is common to have
a multitude of mini-applications in order to separate out the logic into
manageable parts. For instance, Apple's iCloud application has apps for
e-mail, contacts and finding your friends.

This is why there is an **apps/** directory inside of the getting_started project directory. It
allows you to easily separate distinct applications.

Inside the **apps/TodosOne** directory, you will find the sc_config for the TodosOne application.
Just like the project (getting_started) has a **sc_config**, each application or
framework that you create should also have a **sc_config** which specifies it's
requirements as well as any build-options that you may want to change, such as
whether or not to minify and compact the code.

The **core.js** file is the first file that gets loaded, and is where the actual
application is defined. This is also where you usually define any global
constants that the application might use (which should be very few), or any
configuration that external libraries might require.

The **main.js** file is usually very basic. It starts the application. The default
assumes you are using the Statechart framework (which we will discuss in Part 2).
**main.js** simply initializes the statechart, which you will see if you open up **main.js** right now.

The resources folder contains things like images, stylesheets and views.

Inside the resources folder, the **_theme.css** file defines that directory's
CSS theme. This allows you to define different themes for each directory.

The **resources/loading.ejs** file defines the HTML that your users see before
SproutCore has fully loaded and handed control over to the application. For
now, it displays a simple loading message.

Lastly, the **resources/main_page.js** file describes the actual user interface of the
application. Open this file now and take a look. Depending upon how complex
the app becomes, you may decide to have just the mainPage and mainPane, or
you may decide you want to break it out a bit more by having a loadingPane,
loggedInPane, loggedOutPane, etc. Most applications have at least a few
panes, and possibly a few pages.

### Installing the SproutCore framework

```bash
$ sproutcore install sproutcore frameworks
```

This installs the SproutCore framework inside the frameworks folder of your
project.

### Viewing Your Application

So, we have our SproutCore TodosOne application built, and we understand the basic
layout of the files. Let's see what it looks like in the browser!

Inside the project directory type the following command:

```bash
$ sproutcore serve
```

NOTE: If you are attempting to run multiple copies of **sproutcore serve** at the same
time, you will probably see an error about the port already being in use. If
so, just re-run the command and add --port 4030 so the second instance will not use
the default 4020 port.

Using your favorite web browser, visit
http://localhost:4020/TodosOne. If all goes
well, you should see "Welcome to Sproutcore!" in the middle of the screen.

### Making Changes

Open up resources/main_page.js and change the "Welcome to SproutCore!"
line to say "SproutCore is Awesome!". Save the file and refresh the page in
your web browser. If the message updates properly, you're ready to move on to
[Getting Started: Part 2](/getting_started_2.html) of the tutorial.

### Troubleshooting

As with any unfamiliar framework, you may hit a few snags on the way. Below
we list some of the common pitfalls that users have discovered, with
solutions for getting past them.

* *"Browser says 'No matching target'"* - This is generally caused if you
misspelled the name of the application in the URL. Make sure that you properly
typed it, and that you used underscores instead of spaces. For example:
http://localhost/TodosOne.

* *"ERROR: missing } after property list ..."* - This error is usually thrown
if you added a property somewhere, but forgot to put a comma at the end.
Look at the line in the error, and then look above it to see if there is
a comma missing.
