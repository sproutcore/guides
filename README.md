SproutCore Guides
=================

This is the official documentation for the [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com) framework. You can see it live at the [SproutCore Guides homepage](http://guides.sproutcore.com).

This document contains a brief overview of how to contribute changes and additioins to the SproutCore Guides. For an in-depth explanation, see the [Contributing Guide](http://guides.sproutcore.com/contribute.html).

## Getting the Source Code

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [SproutCore Guides repository](https://github.com/sproutcore/guides) on [GitHub](http://github.com).

2. Clone the fork on to your local machine.

        $ git clone git://github.com/<yourname>/guides.git

3. Add the main SproutCore Guides repository as a remote so you can fetch updates.

        $ cd guides
        $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/sproutcore/guides.git

## Installing the Guides Ruby Gem

- Normal gem install

        $ gem install guides

- Install with Bundler

    Alternatively you can use Bundler to install the guides gem. This has the benefit of ensuring that you are using the correct version of the guides gem.

        $ gem install bundler
        $ cd guides
        $ bundle install

## Before Making Changes

Before you make any changes, you'll want to pull in any upstream changes and create a new topic branch for your changes.

    $ git pull upstream/master
    $ git checkout -b <branchname>

## Creating or Modifying a Guide

Guides reside in the `source` directory and are written in a modified version of the [Textile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) markup language. The best way to familiarize yourself with how to use Textile is to check out the other guides.

The guides gem makes it easy to see what the guides on your local machine will look like when they're published to [guides.sproutcore.com](http://guides.sproutcore.com). To preview your changes, do this from the `guides` directory:

    $ guides preview

Now point a web browser to `localhost:9292`. This preview will keep itself updated as you make changes to the guides; all you have to do is refresh your browser window to see your latest changes.

## Submitting Your Changes

You can get your changes and additions included by creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on GitHub using the topic branch you created above.
