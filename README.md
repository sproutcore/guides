SproutGuides
============

Documentation for the SproutCore framework. For more information on SproutCore,
see the [homepage](http://www.sproutcore.com) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore).
These guides are based on the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/).


## Getting Started

In order to start generating documentation, complete the following steps:

- install the [SproutGuides package](http://guides-pkg.strobeapp.com/Guides.pkg)
- clone SproutGuides from git://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides.git
- cd into sproutguides and run `guides build` to generate the output directory

Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to start working with
SproutGuides. You'll do your work inside the source/ directory. As you make
changes, run `guides preview` to see your changes reflected in the output.
