SproutCore Guides
=================

This is the official documentation for the [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com) framework.

Go to [SproutCore Guides](http://guides.sproutcore.com) homepage and check it out.

## Getting Started

In order to start contributing, follow these steps:

- git clone git://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides.git
- install the [Guides package](http://guides-pkg.strobeapp.com/Guides.pkg)

Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to start working with
SproutCore Guides. You'll do most of your work inside the source/ directory. To see
your changes as you work, run `guides preview`. By default, preview will
show guides and content that is still under construction. Under
construction content is not displayed on guides.sproutcore.com, if you
would like to see what content will be deployed run
`guides preview --production`.

For more information on SproutCore Guides, see the [homepage](http://guides.sproutcore.com/contribute.html).
